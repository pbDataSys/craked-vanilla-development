    <p>
      By subscribing to or using the services on MyMinecraftMods, you agree to
      the following terms and conditions.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Service Description</h2>
    <p>
      We provide monthly subscription-based access to exclusive upgrades,
      modifications, or perks on our Minecraft server. These may include special
      ranks, custom items, or performance boosts.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Payments & Renewals</h2>
    <p>
      Subscriptions are billed monthly through Stripe. You may cancel anytime,
      and your access to paid features will continue until the end of your
      current billing cycle.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Refunds</h2>
    <p>
      All payments are final. We do not offer refunds unless required by law.
      Please cancel before your next billing cycle if you no longer wish to
      continue.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Player Conduct</h2>
    <p>
      You agree to follow our server rules. We reserve the right to suspend or
      remove access to the server for violating terms, including griefing,
      cheating, or abusive behavior. Refunds will not be issued for banned
      accounts.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Changes to the Service</h2>
    <p>
      We may change or discontinue features at any time, including modifying
      subscription perks. We will try to notify subscribers of major changes.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Limitation of Liability</h2>

      We are not responsible for gameplay issues, lost progress, or any indirect
